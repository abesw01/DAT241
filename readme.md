# **Public Library Service Areas** 
> Do Public libraries serve to increase success in educating girls in the state of Pennsylvania?

## **Abstract**


## **Background/Rationale**
> In 2017, a book called *Drawdown* was published by the Penguin Books.  The book is a collection of 100 actions that we could take right now to stop the accummulation and reduse the amount of greenhouse gases.  One action that can be implemented right now is to Educate Girls.  Educated girls are more likely to have control of their lives, realize higher wages, greater upward mobility as well as lower maternal mortality (as well as their babies).  Education can break the cycle of poverty.  Education can provide resilience both for the individual and the environment.

## **Analysis Steps**
>
1. Gather data (state outline, county outlines, library locations, education attainment of females)
1. Trim data sets as needed
1. Create QGIS project 
1. Add vectors layers for state outline, counties, library locations
1. Use Count Points in Polylines to create a choropleth of library locations using natural breaks for catergorization
1. Create image to show the choropleth and location of libraries
1. Add delimited text layer for census data for education attainment of females per county
1. Add the areas for land and water per county and convert result from square meters to square miles
1. Join county layer with census data education attainment of females
1. Create images for

## **Conclusions**
>
There is at least one public library in every county in Pennsylvania.

## **Limitations**
>
The 2019 Census data for Education Attainment did not include data for all the counties in Pennsylvania so a comprehensive comparison could not be made.

## **Future research**
>
Several additional data that could be incorporated are data sets concerning poverty and teenage pregnancy; both could affect the outcome of education of girls in that they ccould add social environmental conditions that would prohibit girls from completing their high school education and continuing their education in institutes of higher learning.
>
Another analysis could determine if the programs that public libraries offer help
